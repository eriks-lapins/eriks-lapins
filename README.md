Some projects that I did:

Minesweeper:
You know what I mean. But I did it. In Javascript.

Snake: 
Also, the very classic. Eating apples, growing in size and levels with changing speed and difficulty (added colours that become more similar to apple colours).

A collection of smaller projects: animal zoo - feed them, based on their parent and child classes and what food they eat, tourism planner/city viewer using Foursquare API to get top-5 random location descriptions and images, based on input city, classic tic-tac-toe and some more!

Flight-planner:
Lots of asynchronous code. Currently did the back-end for flight adding, deleting, searching and responses.

Work related:
Confidential :)

Fun idea: What if the universe only appears to accelerate only due to us being in a increasingly higher center of gravity, and in fact, the speed of universe's expansion is actually constant? Did I say I like debates, learning and anything fun and useless?
